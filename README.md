# HTML & CSS Practice Repository
Welcome to my HTML & CSS practice repository! 
This repository contains a collection of simple HTML files that I created to practice and understand core front-end development concepts.
## Overview
This repository includes individual HTML files focusing on different HTML tags, structures, and multimedia elements. It serves as a hands-on learning playground for mastering the basics of web development.
##  Files and Descriptions
| File Name                  | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| `TIMETABLE.HTML`          | A sample class or weekly timetable created using HTML tables. |
| `audiovideoembedding.html`| Practice of embedding audio and video content using `<audio>` and `<video>` tags. |
| `edit.html`               | Demonstrates editable form fields or content-editable sections. |
| `hyperlink.html`          | Example of using hyperlinks (`<a>` tags) to navigate between pages or sites. |
| `id.html`                 | Use of `id` attributes in HTML and their potential use in styling or linking. |
| `listexample.html`        | Demonstration of ordered, unordered, and definition lists. |
| `men.html`                | A profile or themed page (possibly related to menâ€™s section or layout practice). |

| `simpleframeset.html`     | Demonstrates the use of `<frameset>` and `<frame>` (deprecated but learned for legacy knowledge). |

| `table.html`              | Simple use of HTML tables to organize data. |
## Purpose
This repository is part of my learning journey in web development, especially focused on:
- Understanding HTML structure and tags
- Embedding multimedia elements
- Styling with CSS
- Creating structured and accessible web pages

##What's Next?
I plan to enhance these files with external CSS and responsive design practices, and eventually move to JavaScript and frameworks like React.
--- Feel free to explore the files and suggest improvements!
